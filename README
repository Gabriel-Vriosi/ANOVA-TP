In this data analysis study, provided by the Chair of Probability and Statistics under the supervision of the teachers in charge, we have been provided with a database that contains information related to professionals who play roles in the field of Information Technology (IT) or Computer Science. 
We were given the task of analyzing some relationship between variables of our choice present in the database and their corresponding salaries. 
This analysis was carried out using statistical techniques acquired during the second quarter, and was implemented using the Python programming language.

The central objective of this analysis is to identify significant patterns and statistical relationships that can shed light on factors that directly impact the salaries of IT professionals. Through this approach, we seek to provide informed recommendations that contribute to strategic decision-making in the professional field.
